## Project Overview
Guessing game is a application designed to entertain users by allowing them to guess numbers generated by the server. 
Each number comes with a number of attempts and a range in which the number was generated.

### Key Features:
- **TCP-based Communication:** The client and server communicate using TCP sockets, ensuring reliable 
and ordered message delivery.
- **Multi-threading:** The server handles multiple client connections simultaneously using multi-threading, 
allowing scalable client management.
- **MVC Architecture:** Implements the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern to separate the 
application logic from the user interface, facilitating easier maintenance and scalability.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** The application is developed using OOP principles to enhance 
modularity and simplicity in handling game logic, networking, and user interactions.
